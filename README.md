# Whisper_STD
This is the baseline system for the STD task of the Search on Speech ALBAYZIN evaluation. This is based on the Whisper_timestamped tool. The system allows for STD on MAVIR development and test data. The baseline system is in source.zip file, which contains a folder named source/ with two subfolders named MAVIR_development/ that allows for STD on the MAVIR development term set and MAVIR_test/ that allows for STD on the MAVIR test term set. This can be easily extended to other datasets and term sets. For any queries, please contact Javier Tejedor at javier.tejedornoguerales@ceu.es
